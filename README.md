**⚙️ Installation & Setup**
Step 1: Install Python

Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
Download from: https://www.python.org

Step 2: Install Required Libraries

Install dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Run the Model
python model.py
Step 4: Configure API Keys

Edit app.py and add your credentials:

**# Google Generative AI**
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY")

**# Twilio**
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
Step 5: Run the Application
python app.py
Step 6: Open in Browser

Go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000
**🔐 Test Credentials**
Mobile Number: phone_number(XXXXXXXXXX)
Password: password123
**🧠 How It Works**
🔹 Step 1: User Input

User logs in and completes a 3-stage assessment:

General Information

HR-Based Questions

Scenario-Based Questions

🔹 Step 2: Model Processing

HR Inputs → Label Encoding → Random Forest Model

Scenario Text → TF-IDF → Text Classification Model

Combined output determines mental state

🔹 Step 3: Result & Feedback

Prediction displayed on result page

SMS sent to user via Twilio

Optional chatbot support available

🤖 Chatbot Feature

Users can interact with an AI-powered chatbot for mental health support by visiting:
